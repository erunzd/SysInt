Database migrations help manage changes to the database schema over time. They allow developers to modify tables, add or remove columns, and update relationships in a structured way while keeping data intact. Migrations ensure consistency across different environments (development, testing, production) and make it easier to collaborate on database changes without manually altering schemas. <br/>

GraphQL differs from REST by allowing clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of information. Instead of multiple REST endpoints for different operations, GraphQL provides a single flexible endpoint where clients can query multiple resources in a single request. This improves efficiency and optimizes data retrieval, especially for complex applications.
